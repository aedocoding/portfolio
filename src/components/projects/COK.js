            I was assigned to this project during my time in Lambda School's web
            development curriculum - it was a 2 month long group project in
            which our team had a chance to put our training to use in a
            real-world setting. The app was pretty far in development at this
            point but had not yet been deployed to the App Store or Google Play.
            Our job was to make the mobile app achieve feature parity with the
            completed web app on the company's website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Part of what made this project such a great challenge for us was
            being exposed to a completely new tech stack. No one on our team had
            any experience whatsoever in any of the frameworks being used aside
            from Jest, so we had to spend about a week familiarizing ourselves
            with them through online tutorials and the documentation. It
            certainly helped that a lot our training in React made React Native
            feel like an additional layer rather than something completely new -
            but working in the mobile sphere certainly presented it's own unique
            obstacles. While I'm glad for having some time to prepare for the
            project, most of the learning came on the fly during the project
            itself.

          <li>Created modal for logging calls in the app</li>
          <li>
            Created error message to accompany the modal if it isn't logged in
            the app
          </li>
          <li>
            Created form for adding new foster child case and hooked it up to
            backend

          <li>
            Created form for adding new connection/relative of foster child and
            hooked it up to backend
          </li>
          <li>
            Created dynamic filters for cases and connections relatives based on
            criteria like gender and case status.

          <li>
            Fixed bug in which using sorting option for cases or connections
            resulted in nothing happening.

          <li>
            Fixed bug in which list of cases wasn't properly sorted after
            submitting a new case

          <li>Wrote unit tests for adding a new foster child case</li>

            Made styling/formatting changes throughout the app as requested by
